  <h1>About Projex.</h1>

      Projex is a web-based portfolio designed to portray the collection of projects I have worked on. I strongly believe in the effectiveness of hands on application of knowledge to maintain the drive to learn and encourage future learning.
      The projects are supported by detailed design files including source code, .stl files, and circuit diagrams. The projects are treated as products with revisions and complete redesigns appended to the product timeline to show the
      improvements made. I realized the importance of applied learning from my first Arduino kit. I struggled to setup a simple resistor LED circuit even after taking a detailed circuits class offered by my university where we computed voltages
      currents using Kirchhoff’s laws. I took this as an embarrassment for myself and the effectiveness of the textbook / exam driven education system we are taught by. These projects increase my creativity and design confidence along with
      increasing my comfort with the tools used by modern day engineers such as 3D printing, CAD modeling, programming, rapid prototyping, circuit analysis and construction, FEA, design troubleshooting, documentation of work, and most importantly
      critical thinking.

      I hope to one day revise this website into a public engineering forum where developers and engineers can post their own properly documented projects in order to share their experience and knowledge in an opensource environment.
